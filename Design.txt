  Resource
    Random spawns
      Only so many can be spawned at a time
    Has limited quantity
    leaks quantity over time
    dies when out of quantity

  Towers
    Towers run on resource
      Have local storage
    Resource is harvested
    Resource travels on lines to towers
      Pathfinding will suck
      What if we use diffusion instead?
